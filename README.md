## UX/UI Section

### Site goal

The main goal of The Rolling Stones website is to provide users with the information on where they can see their favourite band, whether its on television or live 
concerts. It's very important that the information and navigation is well organized so that users can get all the information they don't have to go to any other 
website. Coding part should be done well so that new administrators can add or change concerts.

### Design choices
In the landing page we want to inform customers about our gym and all the features it provides. Our navigation bar should give basic idea to the users
what they need to achieve their dream body goal.
